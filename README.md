### **Design Choices**
#### **Font**
I chose the Goblin One font for the headings, the styling of the text closely resembles the styling of the text in the logo and stands out well on background images. 
I chose the Raleway font for all body text as it looks elegant and nicely complements the Goblin One font.
#### **Icons**
I used Font Awesome icons for my social media links, favourite button, the shopping cart and users navigation items to name a few  as it gives a intuitive way for users to easily navigate across the site.
#### **Colors**
The color scheme was entirely based around the colour of the logo - I used dev tools to get the exact hex colour of both the yellow background and grey text.
